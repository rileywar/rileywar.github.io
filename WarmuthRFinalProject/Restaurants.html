                “We cook burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and sides fresh-to-order with a hefty dose of Southern hospitality.
                We use 100% fresh ground chuck, the gold standard for cheeseburgers. We hand patty our beef, season it
                perfectly, and cook it to your preferred temperature. Our specialty toppings are made in-shack. We always
                serve fresh, hot, and crispy fries and tots. Our frosty shakes are made with frozen custard from local
                creameries. Our beers are ice cold and our refreshing soft drinks are all served with &#34;that good
                ice&#34;. Come join us for a meal on the patio at the shack or let us bring the shack to you with our
                catering.”

              “Top of the Hill has been a functioning brewery since opening our doors in 1996. Though our roots are in
              English-style ales, we have brewed over 75 different varieties of beer, from our flagship Kenan Lager to
              seasonal favorites with a cult following (we’re looking at you Bell Tower Blueberry Wheat). Our commitment to
              using quality ingredients, like malt from UNC alumni-led Fawcett &amp; Sons, truly sets our beers apart. We
              hope you enjoy them!”
